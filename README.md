A song lyric that is said to be spoken to Sam by Frodo, before whose departure from the Gray Haven.

*I have decided to go*
*Where the cold will never find me*
*To seek a land still green and unstained*

*And I have decided to go*
*Though my feet give out beneath me*
*but parting is no solace for my pain*

*I know it's hard to understand*
*But don't you rather doubt my love for you*
*Oh one day you'll come sailing after*
*When your time comes*

*I have decided to go*
*Where my heart has gone before me*
*To travel where the skyline meets the sea*

*And when I get there I'll know peace*
*Peace that passes understanding*
*The peace that has long eluded me*

*I know it's hard to understand*
*But don't you rather doubt my love for you*
*Oh one day you'll come sailing after*
*When your time comes*

*I know it's hard to understand*
*But don't you doubt my love for you*
*One day you'll cone sailing after*
*When your time has come*

*I have decided to go*
*Where the cold will never find me*

Today I would like to share several lines from *The Prophet* by Kahlil Gibran. Though plain, these lines really remind me of what in deed religion is.

 *And an old priest said, "Speak to us of Religion."*  

 *And he said:*  
 *Have I spoken this day of aught else?*  
 *Is not religion all deeds and all reflection,*  
 *And that which is neither deed nor reflection,*  
 *but a wonder and a surprise ever springing in the soul,*  
 *even while the hands hew the stone or tend the loom?*  
 *Who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?*  
 *Who can spread his hours before him, saying,*  
 *"This for God and this for myself;*  
 *"This for my soul and this other for my body"?*  

 *All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self.*  
 *He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.*  
 *The wind and the sun will tear no holes in his skin.*  
 *And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in a cage.*  
 *The freest song comes not through bars and wires.*  
 *And he to whom worshipping is a window, to open but also to shut,*  
 *has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.*  

 *Your daily life is your temple and your religion.*  
 *Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.*  
 *Take the slough and the forge and the mallet and the lute,*  
 *The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.*  
 *For in reverie you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.*  
 *And take with you all men:*  
 *For in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.*  

 *And if you would know God, be not therefore a solver of riddles.*  
 *Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.*  
 *And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.*  
 *You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising and waving His hands in trees.*

To begin with, a poem by J.R.R.Tolkien is presented below. Enjoy.


  *Roads go ever ever on,*  
  *Over rock and under tree,*  
  *By caves where never sun has shone,*  
  *By streams that never find the sea;*  
  *Over snow by winter sown,*  
  *And through the merry flowers of June,*  
  *Over grass and over stone,*  
  *And under mountains in the moon.*  

  *Roads go ever ever on,*  
  *Under cloud and under star.*  
  *Yet feet that wandering have gone*  
  *Turn at last to home afar.*  
  *Eyes that fire and sword have seen,*  
  *And horror in the halls of stone*  
  *Look at last on meadows green,*  
  *And trees and hills they long have known.*  

  *The Road goes ever on and on*  
  *Down from the door where it began.*  
  *Now far ahead the Road has gone,*  
  *And I must follow, if I can,*  
  *Pursuing it with eager feet,*  
  *Until it joins some larger way,*  
  *Where many paths and errands meet.*  

  *The Road goes ever on and on*  
  *Down from the door where it began.*  
  *Now far ahead the Road has gone,*  
  *And I must follow, if I can,*  
  *Pursuing it with weary feet,*  
  *Until it joins some larger way,*  
  *Where many paths and errands meet.*  
  *And whither then? I cannot say.*  

  *The Road goes ever on and on*  
  *Out from the door where it began.*  
  *Now far ahead the Road has gone.*  
  *Let others follow, if they can!*  
  *Let them a journety new begin.*  
  *But I at last with weary feet*  
  *Will turn towards the lighted inn,*  
  *My evening-rest and sleep to meet.*  

  *Still 'round the corner there may wait*  
  *A new road or secret gate;*  
  *And though I oft have passed them by,*  
  *A day will come at last when I*  
  *Shall take the hidden paths that run*  
  *West of the Moon, East of the Sun.*
