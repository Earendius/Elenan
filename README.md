Today I would like to share several lines from *The Prophet* by Kahlil Gibran. Though plain, these lines really remind me of what in deed religion is.

 *And an old priest said, "Speak to us of Religion."*  

 *And he said:*  
 *Have I spoken this day of aught else?*  
 *Is not religion all deeds and all reflection,*  
 *And that which is neither deed nor reflection,*  
 *but a wonder and a surprise ever springing in the soul,* 
 *even while the hands hew the stone or tend the loom?*
 *Who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?*
 *Who can spread his hours before him, saying,*
 *"This for God and this for myself;*
 *"This for my soul and this other for my body"?*

 *All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self.*
 *He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.*
 *The wind and the sun will tear no holes in his skin.*
 *And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in a cage.*
 *The freest song comes not through bars and wires.*
 *And he to whom worshipping is a window, to open but also to shut,*
 *has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.*

 *Your daily life is your temple and your religion.*
 *Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.*
 *Take the slough and the forge and the mallet and the lute,*
 *The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.*
 *For in reverie you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.*
 *And take with you all men:*
 *For in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.*

 *And if you would know God, be not therefore a solver of riddles.*
 *Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.*
 *And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.*
 *You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising and waving His hands in trees.*

To begin with, a poem by J.R.R.Tolkien is presented below. Enjoy.


  *Roads go ever ever on,*  
  *Over rock and under tree,*  
  *By caves where never sun has shone,*  
  *By streams that never find the sea;*  
  *Over snow by winter sown,*  
  *And through the merry flowers of June,*  
  *Over grass and over stone,*  
  *And under mountains in the moon.*  

  *Roads go ever ever on,*  
  *Under cloud and under star.*  
  *Yet feet that wandering have gone*  
  *Turn at last to home afar.*  
  *Eyes that fire and sword have seen,*  
  *And horror in the halls of stone*  
  *Look at last on meadows green,*  
  *And trees and hills they long have known.*  

  *The Road goes ever on and on*  
  *Down from the door where it began.*  
  *Now far ahead the Road has gone,*  
  *And I must follow, if I can,*  
  *Pursuing it with eager feet,*  
  *Until it joins some larger way,*  
  *Where many paths and errands meet.*  

  *The Road goes ever on and on*  
  *Down from the door where it began.*  
  *Now far ahead the Road has gone,*  
  *And I must follow, if I can,*  
  *Pursuing it with weary feet,*  
  *Until it joins some larger way,*  
  *Where many paths and errands meet.*  
  *And whither then? I cannot say.*  

  *The Road goes ever on and on*  
  *Out from the door where it began.*  
  *Now far ahead the Road has gone.*  
  *Let others follow, if they can!*  
  *Let them a journety new begin.*  
  *But I at last with weary feet*  
  *Will turn towards the lighted inn,*  
  *My evening-rest and sleep to meet.*  

  *Still 'round the corner there may wait*  
  *A new road or secret gate;*  
  *And though I oft have passed them by,*  
  *A day will come at last when I*  
  *Shall take the hidden paths that run*  
  *West of the Moon, East of the Sun.*
